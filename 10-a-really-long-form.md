# A Really Long Form

Different types of tasks take different amounts of time to complete. One Thing Per Page helps users complete tasks in one sitting, but what about those that take hours, or even days, to complete?

In Mailchimp, for example, I'll usually start drafting an email campaign weeks before I send it. And there are a number of steps to complete and in a particular order too. First, I check the content reads well. Then I need to make sure it looks good in various email clients. Then days or even weeks later, I'll run through some final checks, decide the subject line and schedule it for release.

Other tasks are performed by more than one person using the same application. For example, processing a return may involve someone receiving the goods at the warehouse. Then a decision maker may take a look at the goods to make sure it satisfies the returns policy.

Some Government services take weeks to apply for and users need to provide lots of information about their identity, home, family and financial situation and sometimes they need to gather evidence and send it by post.

Whatever the case, if you're designing a really long form, there's some patterns that we can use to improve the experience. 

Of course, if you can simplify the process so that it's short in the first place, all the better.

## The Task List Pattern

In “The Psychology of Checklists”[^1], Lauren Marchese explains the importance of breaking down big tasks into smaller ones and doing so is bioligically proven to motivate people. When we experience even small amounts of success, our brains release a chemical called dopamine which gives us feelings of pleasure, learning and motivation.

Most of us work in teams employing Agile methodologies. One of the main aspects to this is breaking down a large project into epics, stories and tasks. Complete enough tasks, and the story is done. Complete enough stories, and the epic is done. Complete enough epics and the project is done. Of course our work is never done, but you know what I mean.

What's really happening is that tasks seem far easier to achieve when they're broken down. Crucially, if tasks are small enough, then we'll get that hit of dopamine frequently, which creates momentum. Momentum improves morale and morale improves quality.

The task list pattern, as coined by the Government Digital Service (GDS) shows a service that has several top level tasks. Each top level task is broken down into several sub tasks. Each one of those takes users through a flow. Whether it's one screen or several doesn't matter.  Once a task a sub task is completed, users come back to the view with that task marked as complete.

This is not a pattern reserved for Government services. Mailchimp users have a similar need. The only difference is the visual design and the flatter hierarchy of tasks.

Instead of text, Mailchimp uses iconography to mark tasks as complete. I've discussed the pros and cons of iconography in chapter 3, “Book A Flight”. Additionally, instead of standard looking links, they use call-to-action buttons with labelled as ‘resolve’ to prompt the user.

The exact design details you choose to employ will come down to your product's design language and user research.

Key points:

- Each task's status is clearly marked, so that users can see what's left at a glance.
- It gives users an overall feel for how long is left.
- Previous information is saved so that users can return later to complete it.

## When All Tasks Are Complete

When the last task in the list is completed, the user can still go back to the task list page with all the tasks marked as completed. This let's users bask in the glory of completing everything (which is another hit of dopamine). After all, the best part of completing a long to-do list is seeing all those ticks.

It also gives users a chance to review all their answers and make any amends if necessary, which speaks to principle 4, *give control*. The only other thing to remember, is to give users an obvious way to proceed.

## Additional Considerations

The points discussed above are probably applicable to any super long form you're designing, but you might also want to consider:

- Explaining what users need, such as documents, in context of each individual task.
- Indicating how long each task will take. An estimate or a range can work well. If you can't offer this information, then you may need to break down the tasks further.
- Using verbs for task names. For example, ‘Agree to the terms, ‘Create subject line’, ‘Choose template’.
- Listing tasks in order. If so, use an ordered list, the advantages of which are discussed in chapter 5, “An Inbox”.
- Marking who needs to complete the task. This is only useful if the tasks are performed by different people.
- Sizing all the tasks the same. Don't take this too literally, but if one task is 20 questions and another is 2, then maybe you should take another look.

## Summary

In this chapter, we looked at how to break down really long forms into smaller forms, by using the task list pattern. We learnt that doing so is not only biolically proven to help users complete a longer task, but is also gives users the essential information they need to do so.

### Checklist

- Avoid really long forms.
- If you really need one, break the tasks up into smaller pieces.
- Save users state, so that they can come back in their own time.
