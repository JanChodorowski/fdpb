# A Really Long Form

Different types of tasks take different amounts of time to complete. Where One Thing Per Page helps users complete small tasks in one sitting, we haven't considered tasks that take several hours to complete over the course of days, weeks or even months.

In Mailchimp, for example, I'll typically start drafting an email campaign weeks before I send it. And there are a number of discrete steps I'll perform. First, I check the content reads well. Then I need to make sure it looks good in various email clients such as Gmail. Then some time later, I'll run some final checks, decide the subject line and schedule it for release.

Other tasks are performed as a team by different people using the same system. For example, processing a return involves someone at the warehouse receiving the item. Then a decision maker will take a look at the goods to make sure they satisfy the returns policy.

Some Government services take weeks to apply for and users need to provide lots of information about their identity, home, family and financial situation and sometimes they need to gather evidence and send it by post.

Whatever the case, if you're designing a long and unweildly form there's some patterns that we can employ to improve the experience. Of course, if you can simplify the process so that it's short in the first place then you can skip this chapter entirely.

## Break Tasks Down

In “The Psychology of Checklists”[^], Lauren Marchese explains the importance of breaking down big tasks into smaller ones and it's bioligically proven to motivate us.

It's to do with dopamine. In short, when we experience even small amounts of success, our brains release dopamine giving us feelings of pleasure, learning and motivation. I like to call this *momentum*.

Most of us work in teams employing Agile methodologies. One of the main aspects of this is breaking down a large product into epics, stories and tasks. Complete enough tasks, and the story is done. Complete enough stories, and the epic is done.

What's really happening is that tasks seem far easier to achieve when they're broken down. Crucially, if tasks are small enough, then we'll get that hit of dopamine frequently.

## The Task List Pattern

GDS has what they call the task list pattern. Here's how it looks:

![Task list Pattern](.)

The overall application process is broken down into 3 high level tasks, each of which contains sub tasks. Each sub task is small. Completing one marks it as completed.

Mailchimp, as I described earlier uses a similar pattern. Here's how it looks:

Here, Mailchimp prompts users to “resolve” tasks that they haven't completed fully or properly. Each item involves disparate action making it easy to focus and easy to see at a glance at how much is left.

With this technique there's a few things to consider.

## Save Information

If the user wants to check what they've entered they can. If they want to resume later on they can do that too. By marking each task as complete, the user can pick up where they left off easily.

## Explain What Users Need

Documents, types of payment, information.

## Indicate duration

## Use verbs for task names

Should be verbs (like buttons)

## Denote Order

- if order matters
- use an order list (spoken about in inbox)

## Denote Who The Task Is For

## Visual Design

GDS found black states to be error-y. So they used blue. Maybe iconography.

## All Tasks Completed

Once all tasks are completed there should be a large call to action button that takes users forward, normally into their account. At this point users can of course check their answers and make amends should they wish.

Mailchimp do this nicely, giving opportunity to amend whatever. And then schedule or send.
