# A Really Long Form

Some tasks are really long. One Thing Per Page certainly helps users complete a form in one sitting, but some tasks take hours, perhaps spread over several weeks. And to top it off, those tasks may be performed by different people.

In Mailchimp, for example, I typically start drafting an email campaign weeks before I send it. And there are a number of discrete steps I need to perform between time.

First I need to check the content reads well. Then I need to make sure it looks right in Gmail, Outlook and other clients. Then days or weeks later, I'll run some final checks, decide the subject line and schedule it for release.

As another example, LinkedIn users have a profile, and they're encouraged to complete it in order to have a better chance of getting hired. Completing your profile takes a long time and it wouldn't be practical to give users a huge form. They'd never get through it.

Some Government services take weeks to apply for requiring users to provide a lot of information about their identity, their home, family and financial situation. Sometimes the information has to be sent by post and gathered from different personal documents.

Whether it's sending an email campaign, completing a profile, or applying for a service, a long and unweildly form needs special consideration.

## Break tasks down

it's like a todo list - act of ticking things off makes things obvious, but increaes momentum as there is a feeling for each tick and a feeling for completing the overall to do list etc.

GDS has what they call the task list pattern

It also gives users a feel for how long the process is going to take. In ‘A checkout flow’ we discussed how little value there was in providing a progress indicator which makes sense given a 1 minute task. Here though, giving users an indicator of their time is essential.

## Save state

If the user wants to check what they've entered they can. If they want to resume later on they can do that too. By marking each task as complete, the user can pick up where they left off easily.

## Tell users what they'll need before starting each sub task.

## Tell users how long each task approximately takes

## When all tasks are complete

Once all tasks are completed there should be a large call to action button that takes users forward, normally into their account. At this point users can of course check their answers and make amends should they wish.

## Summary

### Things to avoid

- Really long forms
- Not saving state
