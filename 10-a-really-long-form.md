# A long and complex application process

- linkedin has the concept of completing profile too.

Some forms are really long. Other forms involve users having to upload multiple documents (and multiple other things too). Some applications all of these things together.

One Thing Per Page helps users complete a form in one sitting, but some online applications or case management tasks require various information and documents to be prepared over a number of weeks.

Here's an example of a digital service that requires case management and has a long-winded application process: people who unfortunately need help from the state can apply for government assistance in the UK by applying for what's called Universal Credit. As part of the application process, users need to provide various information about themselves. It's a long and unweildly process that requires information about their finances, living arrangements, family members and more.

Because the process is long and complex, and because users don't always have everything they need to hand. Once they finally complete their application, users need to carry out regular tasks to ensured their continued assistance. All of this requires heavy use of forms.

Making long, unweildly and repetitive tasks easy and inclusive, requires extra design considerations.

## Task list pattern

In chapter 3, ‘A checkout flow’ I introduced you to One Thing Per Page. It's an essential pattern because it breaks longer forms into bit-size chunks and keeps momentum. A good checkout flow should take just minutes to complete for the average user. But what if a transaction takes up to an hour or more?

This is where the task list pattern comes in. Simply put, it breaks down a very long form journey into several little ones that make sense to be sub-grouped. Then, as each sub-journey is completed, it's marked as completed.

This pattern lets users fill out various sections in their own time without losing progress. It also gives users a feel for how long the process is going to take. In ‘A checkout flow’ we discussed how little value there was in providing a progress indicator which makes sense given a 1 minute task. Here though, giving users an indicator of their time is essential.

If the user wants to check what they've entered they can. If they want to resume later on they can do that too. By marking each task as complete, the user can pick up where they left off easily.

- time for each task?

Once all tasks are completed there should be a large call to action button that takes users forward, normally into their account. At this point users can of course check their answers and make amends should they wish.

## Summary

### Things to avoid

- Really long forms
