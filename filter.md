# A filter form

## Don't make links look like checkboxes or radios

Material honesty - check Resilient Web Design book for ref.

## AND FILTER

Checkboxes

## OR FILTER

Radios

## One submit

Save many ajax requests.
If loading up entire page is ajax worth it etc.

## Heydon notes

First thing to ask is why don't radios with labels and a separate button work.

One thing I can think of is that a user doesn't know they have to submit.  This is just the way forms work.but because we have fucked them up over the years we may have to reteach them a bit.

This isn't some crazy anti pattern "if u ha e to explain u have failed". Just highlight the button after say 2 seconds for those that seem confused after making their selection.

Everything else is a nonsense approach. Save space. Branding. Less clicks etc.

- select box problem without submit button.
