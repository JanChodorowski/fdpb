# Principles to address

## Use the right field for the right keyboard

## Primary principles

- Though shall make label text extra clear. Password vs "Current password" or "New password".

- Though shall put form elements in a single column.


- Only ask for absolutely necessary stuff. Ask for it as late as possible. Progressive. If there are optional fields, mark those; not the required fields. 300 million button jared spool. Mr Joe, Boring Forms.

Jared Spool video about how got loads of sign ups but no sales. We want the right investment. For example growth labs by whats his chops makes u go thru an entire email funnel before signing up for his course. No link to get there without it. Investment => proper sign up and longevity. Something to consider. https://www.uie.com/jared-live/#design-opposed

## Validation

- Forgive mistakes: trim, spaces, uppercase etc. date of birth, postcode fields. Jared spool, 42 mins, Design Is Metrically Opposed: "it takes one line of code to trim brackets and dashes from a telephone number, but it takes 10 lines to tell the user they typed something wrong".

- CCV code disappears once the page refreshes and says "ur card number was wrong" - also in the same video above.

- Success messages: Once shown, don't hide automatically. Let the user dismiss if at all. Probably want to take them somewhere rather than show a success above the form. Back to account landing, on to the next step. back to home page as last resort etc.

## These require specific examples

- Though shall always design a form based on context, not on reuse. Kidly onboarding expecting vs has kids.

- Though shall not use unfriendly defaults. Anti pattern. "Uncheck the box if you don't wish to get email"

- Though shall ensure captchas are user-friendly to everyone Christopherson

- Though shall not to try to customise the look and feel too much

## These are rare and low priority

- Though shall not use sliders unless they really have to (maybe a colour picker) (Mr Joe again)

- Though shall avoid multiple select controls

- Make sure space below the combined label/field is more. https://uxdesign.cc/design-better-forms-96fadca0f49c#.iy0c5in6p

<!-- highligh, a highlight is to show something different from the norm. Optional fields are different from the norm so mark those. Jessica Enders.-->

- [Placement/position](http://adrianroselli.com/2017/01/avoid-messages-under-fields.html)

- When the page refreshes must populate values as to not make users have to type it in again. Annoying.

-Caroline book: search for "Use error messages that respect the effort the user is making."
