# A Basket Form

## Making multiple edits

Need one big form.

## Multiple Submit buttons

Update vs save and continue.

If lots of individual forms, and no bulk edit, then checkout is a link not a button. Buttons not links hand cursor. But call to action. check heydons book on that. Slightly different design but still obvious call to action.

## Labels/placeholders

- Also the quantity is populated so can show the placeholder problem for populated values.

## May not need update form

- to show problem with placeholders. Probably shouldnt do it just for that.
- to show labelling on the button.
- to show different sized fields.
- to explain where to go back to after success. Never stay on the same page? Or may you should? Sometimes you will want to stay on the same page depending on the form. Like writing this book. Save the details but carry on making edits. Needs thinking about.
