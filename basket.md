# A Basket Form

If lots of individual forms, and no bulk edit, then checkout is a link not a button. Buttons not links hand cursor. But call to action. check heydons book on that. Slightly different design but still obvious call to action.

- Need one big form.
- Button labels for multiple submits. Update vs Save And Continue.
- Multiple submit problem
- Where to go back to after success. Never stay on the same page? Or may you should? Sometimes you will want to stay on the same page depending on the form. Like writing this book. Save the details but carry on making edits. Needs thinking about.
