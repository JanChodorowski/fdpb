# Really hard and long form

What we know:

- most sites don't need progress bar. If most wizards are small, what's the point, they take up room and haven't been shown to make much of a difference, and with any flow that is dynamic you're going ot have a problem.
- one thing per page works really well, at least as a start

But what about a really long form. Isn't an indication of progress or ‘where’ am i  and ‘how far along am i’ useful in respecting the user. In a really long form, we can't just have users press next forever and ever, until finally reaching the end.

But we also don't want users have a one super long form as we know that probably doesn't work. Enter the task list pattern.

## Task list pattern

## Upload

- input type file
- offline process, do that async offline, get email to know when finished and security checked.
- allow to select multi files and lack of support
- way to do this without it?
- drag drop (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqSlVvKvvjQ)
