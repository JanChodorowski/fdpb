# Introduction

There are two main ways in which users surf the web. They consume information which is passive, and they also input information which is active. This latter part is taken care of using forms.

Forms are interesting because whilst in many respects they are so simple, they do attract a host of problems when it comes to usability. They are often the target of innovative designs that in the end are of no use to users.

In fact, as much as I love designing forms, they are a source of friction for users. They are certainly not a joy. With that said, designing a good form isn't that hard.

I've found that there are a handful of pitfalls, some no brainers and a few amazing techniques in which we can utilise to our user's advantage and happiness.

In this book, we'll explore, through practical examples, a whole bunch of different forms. And it will be our aim to design these to be simple, human _and_ inclusive.

Let's get started.
