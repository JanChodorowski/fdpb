# Introduction

There are two main ways in which users surf the web. They consume information which is passive, and they also input information which is active. This latter part is taken care of using forms.

Forms are interesting because whilst in many respects they are so simple, they do attract a host of problems when it comes to usability. They are often the target of innovative designs that in the end are of no use to users. We should focus on user frustration when it comes to any aspect of a user's experience with our product.

When it comes to forms, user's won't be delighted because a label animated or that text boxes are styled *differently*. They will be delighted because they got through it easily. Things made sense. Fields were understandable. When and if they made an error, it was clear why, and therefore fixing it was easy.

In fact, as much as I love designing forms, they are a source of friction for users. They are certainly not a joy. With that said, designing a good form isn't that hard.

I've found that there are a handful of pitfalls, some no brainers and a few amazing techniques in which we can utilise to our user's advantage and happiness.

In this book, we'll explore, through practical examples, a whole bunch of different forms. And it will be our aim to design these to be simple, human _and_ inclusive.

Let's get started.

Mention about what it means to be simple. What it means to be human. What it means to be inclusive.

Nobody wants to use ur site, or ur form. We wanted the desired outcome.
