# Introduction

There are two main ways in which users surf the web. They consume information which is passive, and they also input information which is active. This latter part is taken care of using forms.

Forms are interesting because whilst in many respects they are so simple, they do attract a host of problems when it comes to usability. They are often the target of innovative designs that in the end are of no use to users.

We won't delight user's because a label animates or that text boxes are styled *differently*. We can only delight users because the form was as easy to use as possible. Users want the outcome of filling the form, not the act of filling the form itself.

To do make a form easy to use we need it to make sense. We need to give the user a reason to fill it out in the first place. And if a user makes an error, fixing it is easy too.

In fact, as much as I love designing forms, they are a source of friction for users. They are certainly not a joy. With that said, designing a good form isn't that hard.

I've found that there are a handful of pitfalls, some no brainers and a couple of excellent techniques in which we can use to our user's advantage.

In this book, we'll explore, through practical examples, a whole bunch of different forms. And it will be our aim to design these to be simple, human _and_ inclusive.


This book is not necessarily the definitive guide of how to design all forms all the time. As much as my ego would like to think it knows best, it does not. Don't get me wrong there are plenty of DOs and DONTs but more importantly than that, it's about the way we analyse how we design forms.

Let's get started.

Mention about what it means to be simple. What it means to be human. What it means to be inclusive.

Nobody wants to use ur site, or ur form. We wanted the desired outcome.
