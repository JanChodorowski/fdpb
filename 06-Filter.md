# Search And Filter

## 1. Designing a global search in responsive header

If search is used a lot, don't make people click a magnifying glass. It's really annoying. Also once someone searches, at least consider keepign it open.

## 2. Search shouldn't just find products [https://medium.com/uie-brain-sparks/content-and-design-are-inseparable-work-partners-5e1450ac5bba](Jared Spool)

## 3. Do we really need it? Kidly didn't do search as product taxonomy so small. Let Google do it.

## 4. Filter

- Don't make links look like checkbox/radios (https://medium.com/@z_rose/oh-boy-form-design-df6a71e39d60)
- Material honesty - check Resilient Web Design book for ref.
- AND = checkboxes
- OR = radios
- select box problem without submit button.
- One submit button, save many ajax requests, is ajax worth it for entire page of results?

### 4.2 Heydon notes

First thing to ask is why don't radios with labels and a separate button work.

One thing I can think of is that a user doesn't know they have to submit.  This is just the way forms work.but because we have fucked them up over the years we may have to reteach them a bit.

This isn't some crazy anti pattern "if u ha e to explain u have failed". Just highlight the button after say 2 seconds for those that seem confused after making their selection.

Everything else is a nonsense approach. Save space. Branding. Less clicks etc.
