# Search And Filter

I'm organised. Even as Kid I was organised. I've always been minimalist too. Organising things when you only have a few things is quite easy.

I rarely lost things but when I did, all I had to do was shout in the general direction of the resident search engine "Where's my..." and the search engine would tell me.

By search engine, I mean my mum. Mum knew where everything was. Not just my stuff. Everyone's. This was one of her many qualities. She didn't just know where stuff was, she knew the answer to any question I had.

If I could go back in time and accelerate my nerdyness a little bit, I might have nicknamed her Google.

I'm a dad now, and as much as I try not to, I own more things. It's hard to be a minimalist with a wife and kid. Even if I meticulously organise our things it's hard to remember where everything is.

I'm left to peruse each cupboard one by one. And of course when I need said *thing* and can't find it, I become anxious. If I really want it and know it exists I'll perservere. If not, I'll give up.

Sometimes when I asked mum questions, she would ask me questions in return. Questions like "what colour is it?" and "is it for football or tennis?".

I'd tell her and she would give me the answer. These questions are filters on a largers set of search results.

In this chapter we're going to be looking at search and filter. Just like mum we'll want these things to be in easy reach and as human as possible.

## 1. Designing a global search in responsive header

If search is used a lot, don't make people click a magnifying glass. It's really annoying. Also once someone searches, at least consider keepign it open.

## 2. Search shouldn't just find products [https://medium.com/uie-brain-sparks/content-and-design-are-inseparable-work-partners-5e1450ac5bba](Jared Spool)

## 3. Do we really need it? Kidly didn't do search as product taxonomy so small. Let Google do it.

## 4. Filter

- Don't make links look like checkbox/radios (https://medium.com/@z_rose/oh-boy-form-design-df6a71e39d60)
- Material honesty - check Resilient Web Design book for ref.
- AND = checkboxes
- OR = radios
- select box problem without submit button.
- One submit button, save many ajax requests, is ajax worth it for entire page of results?

### 4.2 Heydon notes

First thing to ask is why don't radios with labels and a separate button work.

One thing I can think of is that a user doesn't know they have to submit.  This is just the way forms work.but because we have fucked them up over the years we may have to reteach them a bit.

This isn't some crazy anti pattern "if u ha e to explain u have failed". Just highlight the button after say 2 seconds for those that seem confused after making their selection.

Everything else is a nonsense approach. Save space. Branding. Less clicks etc.

If simple taxonomy u don't need it.

If I do then emasure what users want most.

Then expose it. Don't hide it.

## Notes

Mum.knew where EVERYTHING was. Not just products or articles.

I don't have a mum on hand to shout at. Sometimes I shout at my wife, but her search engine is rarely well indexed or up to date.
