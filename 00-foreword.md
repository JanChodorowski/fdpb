Every so often someone will point out that I use blackish text on whitish backgrounds for almost all my page layouts. And the only comeback I can think of is that the same approach has worked for hundreds of billions of publications over the course of hundreds of years. You know, that old chestnut.

Making a habit of flouting convention will garner you attention; spark controversy and earnest debate; even earn you awards. But it will also confound and alienate your readers and users â€” the people your work is really meant for.  That is abject failure.

Paradoxically, in a world saturated with rule breaking and reinvention, a reverence for the straightforward, familiar, and simple becomes radical. And it's a welcome revolution, because interfaces that are obvious are also inclusive. It's not a bad thing to be *on the nose*.

Let me give you an example. Imagine my excitement when reading this book, to find Adam recommending that form labels should appear *above* their respective inputs. Not off to the side at an angle, not inside the input *where the actual user input should go*, and certainly not as some absurd animated combination of different positions and orientations at different times. 

That's actually radical, and really refreshing to read. Because most designers will do anything *but* the expected. Then I have to tell them off on behalf of the users they're forcing to decipher their interface. Nobody has time for that.

Don't get me wrong; I'm not saying there's nothing new in this book. I personally learned plenty. It's just that my reaction was never "okay, I guess that's one way of doing it LOL" and always "damn, that's it, I should have been doing this all along." And it turns out that when you combine standard elements and simple concepts, even daunting components like the airplane seat chooser can be accessible, logical, and lightweight.

To me, this book is about simple solutions to would-be complex problems. As such, it's not just about forms, but if you can make forms easy and pleasurable to use (forms!), then most everything else will be a cinch.
