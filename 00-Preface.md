# Preface/Introduction

I recall my first experience of learning web design and development. It consisted of copying other people's code and making changes until something broke, then quickly undoing that change to make things okay again.

There were tables everywhere, some styling and the odd bit of Javascript pasted as is. Oh and framesets. One must not forget those bad boys. But all of this was about the output of something. Besides clicking links to new pages or some useless Javascript animation, there was little meaningful interaction.

That was until people started creating a contact form page. These things confused the hell out of me. Just as I did with everything else back then, I would view the source and cut and paste the HTML. The HTML consisted of form elements so as went to refresh, the form was there. I thought to myself, that was easy.

But then submitting the form did nothing. I thought I must have to supply an email address or something as an attribute. It was not this simple. I got into the world of CGI scripts. The thought of those, even now, with more than 15 years passed still gives me the heeby geebies.

When I say *got into the world of*, I mean I would cut and paste scripts and put them in the right folder, CGI-BIN, if I recall using some sort of FTP program. FTP was another thing that confused the hell out of me. I remember the first web project I did for someone, and it had a contact form and I just couldn't get it to work.

Fortunately for me, I was good friends with the smartest guy in school, and he just was good at everything. He did some sort of CHMOD, edited the script and bingo, the form worked and I invoiced my client accordingly.

You'd think after enduring such an experience I would steer clear of forms, but it was the reverse. I became obsessed with forms, particularly forms revolving around e-commerce. This would including adding to basket, taking payment and uploading images (in a CMS to drive the ecommerce site of course).

Viewing the source of Amazong didn't help so I had to read and trawl for hours, days, maybe months, and read a whole bunch of books. I owned a Windows PC so the technology was Classic ASP, later followed by ASP.NET. As soon as you had to process a form, you needed a server. I then had to setup one of these. It was horrible stuff, and stuff that I didn't really get.

Servers, clients, ports, ASP. And once I had all that done, I had to learn databases and blob storage. Hurrendous. The world of web exploded out of all proportion.

I was obsessed with all this, because to have a dynamic website, meant having forms that saved and updated information. And once I learned all this stuff, I needed to learn all the different types of form fields.




- Forms are boring. I've never thought that.
- my obsession with forms
- equal amounts common sense, my research and other people's.
- principles
- why patterns


Don't be fooled by its simple appearance though. There's a lot of ground to cover and patterns that will emerge. Patterns we'll either use directly or as a foundation to build new patterns when needed.

Refer to inclusive principles in this from heydon that i can refer to.

Refer to the principles from GDS to do the same thing.
