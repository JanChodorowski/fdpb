# Introducion

I remember my first experience of forms. Back in 2000, web design was one of the course modules. It mostly consisted of cutting and pasting snippets of HTML, CSS and Javascript and making them my own. My obsession with forms began around the same time, like with any other HTML element, I tried to cut and paste it. When I did, the form rendered fine. But submitting it did nothing. Dazed and confused I eventually realised the things I was missing. Fast forward 17 years and here I am: Writing a book about form design patterns.

## Why forms?

Every meaningful interaction that happens on the web is achieved by a form of some sort. That's because without forms, the web becomes passive, just a way to read stuff. That's great and all, but we can make the web far more interactive. Forms are the vessel by which users can create, update and delete things. Whether it's commenting on a blog post, buying a product and having it delivered to your door, all the way through a fully fledged adminstrative system, forms are always front and center.

## Why patterns?

Design patterns serve as guidance and solutions to those who solve similar problems over and over. The reason for design patterns are twofold. 

First, instead of solving the same problem from scratch every time, we can instead refer to previously used, available, recognised and well-researched solutions. Ultimately this saves a lot of time and makes use of our time to solve new problems.

Second, by solving the same problem in the same way, users get a more consistent and coherent experience. That is, the service becomes familiar. Familiar interfaces requires users to think less. This is because they know how something works based on previous experience. In doing so they have to exert less energy doing the thing.

Think about it, every time you encounter a door, you intuitively know that it can be opened, closed and sometimes locked. You know all this stuff without thinking. It just happens. It's just how it is. Easy. Leveraging patterns for forms or more broadly, the web, is simply a sensible thing to do.

## Why these particular problems?

When I first outlined the book, I did so based on principles. I came up with about 50 or so. Things like, ‘every field should have a label’. The problem with evaluating problems based on principle is that quite often, the same principles come up for very different problems. What makes more sense is to tackle tangible problems the same way as we would do so in the workplace.

So then I set out to try and encompass the 50 principles naturally and by example. I came up with 7 chapters that solve a bunch of different problems. Those problems are almost definitely applicable to your own project. They've certainly been applicable to the slew of projects I've worked on for the past 15 years.

Personally, I want to solve common problems in a robust and fully inclusive way. Seeing as you're here, I'm guessing you do too.

## Principles

Even though, I've purposely moved away from orientating the chapters around principles, that does not mean principles are disguarded all together. Before we design things, we need to be upheld to some principles. What are we without our principles anyway?

When defining principles we can either steal other peoples or come up with our own. But before we get to that, it's worth a look at how we decide what our principles are in the first place.

This is a book about designing forms for consumption on the web. As such we would be remiss to ignore the essence of the web itself. The very power of it is one of reach and accessibility. Anyone with a connection and a browser gets access to the same thing as anyone else.

Whichever principles we want to aspire to, I think aligning with this sentiment is a bloody good start. Whatever it is we build, we want to have considered and designed for the swath of users that have access to the web. A good approach is to design with an inclusive hat on. This means design for everyone. Therefore, I can think of no better principles than those found at on Inclusive Design Principles Dot Org. Interestingly only one of their principles (out of seven) pertain to accessibility. The others just sound like good design. Let's lay them out in black and white now:

- Dah
- Dah

Throughout the book we'll pick off these principles and point out where our design fails and succeeds in these regards. These principles, should, at least indirectly, guide us during the design process. See you on the other side.
