# Introducion

I remember my first experience of forms. Back in 2000, web design was one of the modules for my AVCE ICT course. It mostly consisted of cutting and pasting snippets of HTML, CSS and Javascript. Yep, I came from the view-source school of web development.

My obsession with forms started when&mdash;like with any other HTML&mdash;I tried to cut and paste it. Despite it rendering okay, submitting did nothing. Fast forward 17 years and here I am writing a book about form design patterns.

## Why forms?

Every meaningful interaction that happens on the web is achieved by a form of some sort. That's because without forms the web merely becomes a passive experience, just a way to consume content. Forms are the vessel by which users can create, update and delete things. Whether it's commenting on a blog post, buying a product, banking or working on a fully fledged adminstrative digital system, forms are always front and center.

## Why patterns?

Design patterns serve as guidance and solutions to those who solve similar problems over and over. The reason for design patterns are twofold.

First, instead of solving the same problem from scratch every time, we can instead refer to previously used, available, recognised and well-researched solutions. Ultimately this saves a lot of time, the one resource on earth we can't make more of.

Second, by solving the same problem in the same way, users get a more consistent and coherent experience. That is, the service becomes familiar. Familiar interfaces requires users to think less. This is because they know how something works based on previous experience. In doing so they have to exert less energy doing the thing. Steve Krugs seminal book Don't Make Me Think is all about this subject.

Think about it, every time you encounter a door, you intuitively know that it can be opened, closed and sometimes locked. You know all this stuff without thinking. It just happens. It's just how it is. Easy. Leveraging patterns for forms or more broadly, the web, is simply a sensible thing to do.

## Why these particular problems?

I first outlined this book based on principles. I had about 50 or so, and the original plan was that each would become a short chapter. For example, there would be a chapter entitled ‘Every form field needs a label’.

The problem with evaluating problems based on principles is that they quite often apply to multi problems. Discussing one principle often complements or coincides with another. In other respects, principles are abstract.

Instead, it makes more sense to tackle problems the same way anyone would in the workplace. By taking a problem and designing a solution for by stepping through various scenarios and constraints. So I then changed course, and instead of 50 principles I came up with 7 chapters. Each chapter solves a real life problem that is almost definitely applicable to your project. They've certainly been applicable to the slew of projects I've been involved in for the past 17 years.

Personally, I want to solve common problems in a user-centered way. Seeing as you're here, I'm guessing you do too.

## What about principles?

Whilst I've purposely moved away from principle-orientated chapters, that doesn't mean we should disguard principles altogether. Before we design things, anything, we need to be upheld to some principles. What are we without our principles anyway?

When defining principles we can either steal other peoples or come up with our own. But before we get to that, it's worth a look at how we might decide what our principles are in the first place.

This book is about designing forms for the web. As such it would be remiss of us to ignore the essence of the web itself. The very power of it, is one of reach and accessibility. Anyone with a browser and an Internet connection has access to it. Whatever principles we go for, aligning with this sentiment is a good start. We don't want to design anything that breaks the web for people.

Whatever we build, we should be thinking about users. On the web, that's everyone. Inclusive design is about designing for everyone, therefore I can think of no better set of principles than those written by Heydon Pickering and Heni Swan of Paciello Group. Interestingly, only one of the seven principles pertains to accessibility. The other ones are just *good* design. Let's lay them out in black and white.

- Dah

We'll refer back to these principles throughout the book, pointing out where a solution fails or succeeds to meet them. These principles should at least indirectly hold us to throughout the design process. See you on the other side.
