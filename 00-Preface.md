# Introducion

My forms obsession started when I was trying to cut and paste form html (like I did any other non form element) and nothing happened. FSt forward 17 years later and here we are. But why forms and why patterns?

## Why forms?

Why forms. Every meaningful interaction on the web is achieved by a form of some sort. A form is the vessel by which users can create, update and delete a thing. Be it commenting on a blog post, buying a product all the way through to a fully fledged administrative system, forms are always front and center.

## Why patterns?

Design patterns serve as guidance to those who solve similar problems over and over. The reason why that is useful is twofold.

First, instead of solving the same problems from scratch, we can refer to previously used, available, recognised and well-tested patterns which saves us a lot of time.

Second, by solving similar problems in similar ways, the experience becomes familiar to users. Familiar experiences require uses to think less because they just know how something works based on previous experience.

Think about it, every time you approach a door you intuitively know that it needs to opened and closed and that it leads to some destination. The same goes for patterns.

Leveraging design patterns for forms or any other problem space is simply a sensible thing to do.

Why these particular problems?

I've thought long and hard before picking these particular problems to solve with you. The short of it is that these are the problems that come up over and over from project to project.  I want to solve common problems in a robust and fully inclusive way.  Seeing as you're here, I'm guessing it's the same for you.

Why by example. Reference bits in evaluation by pattern. Being told what to do is one thing. Being trained through example is an entirely other matter. Much better.

Before we can design solutions, we need to be upheld to some principles. What are we without those. So we need to either create some or steal other people's. But how do we come up with design principles?

This is a book about designing forms for consumption on the web. As such we would be remiss to ignore the essence of the web itself. The very power of the web is one of reach and accessibility. Anyone with a connection and a browser gets access to the same thing as anyone else.

If we're going to choose any principles I think it has to align with this. That whatever it is we build considers the swath of users that exist in the world. Designing inclusively means designing for everyone. Everyone has access to the internet. So I can think of no better place to steal principles than the ones at Inclusive Design Principles Dot Org.

Interestingly only one of those principles pertains to accessibility. The others just sound like.good design.  Here they are laid out bare for your convenience.

Throughout this book well.be referring back to these principles and pointing out where our design fails and succeeds in these regards. Principles should at least indirectly guide us through the design process.

# Introduction

I remember my first experiences with web design. It was 2000 and one of the modules on my AVCE ICT course was ‘web design’. Class mostly consisted of copying other people's code via *view source* and make small changes.

I built up a fair understanding of most elements. The complex ones were framesets and tables because we used those to design interesting layouts. Links were easy, you just pointed the `href` at the page and everything worked, but forms were different. They were special.

*View source* didn't work. I mean it did work, to an extent. But only in that it rendered the form in the browser. Submitting the form did nothing. I became obsessed with trying to get the form to do *something*. I remember trying to copy Amazon's add-to-basket form in the hope that I could build my own ecommerce store. After an embarassing amount of time I learned that I was missing a little thing called a *server*. This opened up a brand new ‘can of worms’.

In those days as a web developer you were responsible for many facets: databases, servers, HTML and design. Nowadays they have a special term called *full stack*. I realised quickly back then that I was far more concerned with the interaction and experience side of things than I was databases. I quickly specialised as a Front-end Developer.

My obsession with forms never subsided and I've always found myself working on highly interactive websites, not just those that present information. From ecommerce websites to administrative applications, forms have always played a major role. If you're reading this book, it's probably the same for you.

## Evaluation by problem

When I first had the idea to write a book about form design, it started as a list of ~50 principles with a chapter for each one. As I tried to write each one, I found it jarring and I never really knew why. Then I read Heydon Pickering's book Inclusive Design Patterns where he mentioned this exact problem.

In short, when we're in the workplace and we're trying to design something, we don't start with the principles and make the design match those. It's the other way around. We orientate ourselves around a problem and apply various applicable principles to those. Specifically, we often apply the same principles to many different problems. 

Trying to discuss principles in the abstract simply isn't practical. Having discovered Heydon's lightbulb moment, I quickly changed course and sketched out several chapters that would encompass the ~50 principles by solving real world problems. The result is this book.

## Principles

Just because the page isn't designed around principles, doesn't mean we're not designing to them. Principles still have a solid place in this book and we'll refer to many throughout. This book aims to produce and define several reusable patterns. Any design system is usually founded on principles and this book is no different.

When designing solutions to problems, including those revolving around forms we need to have principles and morals. What are we without those anyway?

Every design-led company seem to revolve themselves around their design principles. I've always found most of them a bit abstract. A bit having them just for the sake of having them.

But they don't have to be this way. Refer to Alla book to get fish some good principles out and explain how the teams have been centered by them.

Principles, when practical and applicable, can be tremendously powerful and double up as constraints. That's what design is, solving problems within a set of constraints. For example, why do we have doors? If there weren't any constraints you just wouldn't have a building or an entrance. But we need a building for shelter. We need an entrance to get in and out of the shelter. It needs to be a certain size so that we, humans, of all shapes and sizes can make our way in and out, but we don't neccessarily want insects and water coming in if we can help it.

Coming up with principles isn't an easy task. Fortunately other people have come up with so many principles, that we can just cherry pick the best ones and use them as our own. It's about choosing the right ones. Heydon's Inclusive Design Principles are most appropriate for this book. But why?

I think that's what the web is born on isn't it. Isn't that the webs super power(prog enhancement article js). Naturally then, designing inclusively really means design.

Let's lay out these principles first here.

And as the web is no longer a suckling baby the are now since solid and useful techniques we can use to meet the principles.

Principles ultimately map to the needs of users. As designers, we are overly interested in users, what else is there? This all seems rather sensible and it is.

Ah what do we do with all these thing s? Well keep then in mind, and check ourselves against the principles right the book. If by the end of the book you think we have taken short then you can reach out to me and we can get that solved together.

## Why patterns?

Most solutions, including those found in this book, are applicable to so many problems and different domains and websites. That's what patterns help. Don't solve the same problem twice. From micro to macro patterns, this book will help you solve common blah instead of doing the same thing over and over.

- Forms are boring. I've never thought that.
- equal amounts common sense, my research and other people's.


Don't be fooled by its simple appearance though. There's a lot of ground to cover and patterns that will emerge. Patterns we'll either use directly or as a foundation to build new patterns when needed.

Refer to inclusive principles in this from heydon that i can refer to.

Refer to the principles from GDS to do the same thing.
