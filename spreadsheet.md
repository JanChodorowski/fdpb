# Spreadsheet

This is a placeholder for a table that allows user to inline edit stuff. Like DMC (Graham) or trading software.

Either way, tables and forms don't work well together. If need to edit, take the one thing per page approach and go and edit it on a dedicated screen. Don't have to page refresh - could use a modal, or just change state of screen etc. Once complete, take the user back to where they were.
