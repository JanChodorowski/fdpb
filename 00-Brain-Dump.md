# Principles to address

## 1. Use this quote somewhere, perhaps in checkout?

> Hereâ€™s what I bring to the table: a valid credit card, 90 seconds of my time, and my right thumb. The rest is up to you.

## 2. On complex password rules

> Sorry but your password must contain an uppercase letter, a number, a haiku, a gang sign, a hieroglyph, and the blood of a virgin.

## 3. Autofill information

## 4. Optional/Required fields

- a highlight is to show something different from the norm. Optional fields are different from the norm so mark those. by Jessica Enders
- If there are optional fields, mark those; Mr Joe, Boring Forms.

## 5. The right investment

Jared Spool video about how got loads of sign ups but no sales. We want the right investment. For example growth labs by whats his chops makes u go thru an entire email funnel before signing up for his course. No link to get there without it. Investment => proper sign up and longevity. Something to consider. https://www.uie.com/jared-live/#design-opposed

## 6. Validation notes

- Forgive mistakes: trim, spaces, uppercase etc. date of birth, postcode fields. Jared spool, 42 mins, Design Is Metrically Opposed: "it takes one line of code to trim brackets and dashes from a telephone number, but it takes 10 lines to tell the user they typed something wrong".

- CCV code disappears once the page refreshes and says "ur card number was wrong" - also in the same video above.

-Caroline book: search for "Use error messages that respect the effort the user is making."

## 7. Success messaging

- Once shown, don't hide automatically. Let the user dismiss if at all. Probably want to take them somewhere rather than show a success above the form. Back to account landing, on to the next step. back to home page as last resort etc.

## 8. Show form based on context.

- Though shall always design a form based on context, not on reuse. Kidly onboarding expecting vs has kids.

## 9. Captures

- Though shall ensure captchas are user-friendly to everyone Christopherson

## 10. Field position and spacing notes

- Make sure space below the combined label/field is more. https://uxdesign.cc/design-better-forms-96fadca0f49c#.iy0c5in6p

- [Placement/position](http://adrianroselli.com/2017/01/avoid-messages-under-fields.html)

## 11. Populate after page refresh

- When the page refreshes must populate values as to not make users have to type it in again. Annoying.

## 12. Pressing back

- post redirect get: graham?

## 13. One thing per page h1/legend/label

- one thing per page then h1 and legend/label???
